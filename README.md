# python-api-challenge

In the first part of the challenge I analyzed the weather conditions of 514 cities all over the world, I made a scatter plot of the latitude of each city and the max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed to see if there was a correlation between the variables and also analyzed them separately in each hemisphere and added to each plot a linear regression.
