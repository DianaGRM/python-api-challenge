# python-api-challenge

In the first part of the challenge I analyzed the weather conditions of 514 cities all over the world, I made a scatter plot of the latitude of each city and the max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed to see if there was a correlation between the variables and also analyzed them separately in each hemisphere and added to each plot a linear regression. 

The second part I made a plot that shows each city in a geographical map to see the location of the cities, listed my perfect weather conditions for vacation, and applied them in the data frame with a filter. In the end, there were 21 cities with that weather conditions but only 15 had a hotel. Finally, I made a geograph with those 15 cities. 


Specific details of the script are added as comments in each jupyter notebook.
